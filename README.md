# quantum-visualization-p5js
This p5.js project visually interprets quantum mechanics, focusing on the wave-particle duality principle. It showcases an interactive canvas where particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. Users can transform these particles into shapes of a circle, a cube and a person, merging science with art and philosophy.
