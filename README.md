# Quantum Visualization in p5.js

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive visualization created with p5.js that explores and illustrates the concept of wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. Through this artistic interpretation, users can interact with a canvas, transforming particles into various shapes that subtly reflect the characteristics of quantum phenomena.

## Features
- **Interactive Canvas**: Click to see particles dynamically form shapes, each symbolizing different aspects of the natural world and universe.
- **Creative Take on Quantum Mechanics**: A visual representation of wave-particle duality, blending science with digital art.
- **Engaging and Educational**: Ideal for those interested in physics, digital art, or interactive web technologies.

## Interactive Demo
Experience the visualization directly in your browser through the p5.js Web Editor. [Try it out here!](https://editor.p5js.org/Taq_1836/sketches/IUPyM4cDMl)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start interacting with the visualization.
3. Experiment by clicking on the canvas and observe the transformation of particles.

## Technologies Used
- **p5.js**: Built with p5.js, a JavaScript library designed to make creative coding accessible and enjoyable.
